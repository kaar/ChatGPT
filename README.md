$ echo "Write something fun about abstract functions in Python" | ./chat.py

An abstract function in Python is like a superhero with a secret
identity. From the outside, it looks just like a normal function, but
it has special powers that allow it to perform incredible feats. For
example, an abstract function can override other functions and control
their behavior, or it can even define new behavior for a whole class of
objects. But just like a superhero, an abstract function can only use
its powers for good â€“ it must be implemented by a concrete subclass
before it can be called, so that it can help solve real-world problems
and make the world a better place.
